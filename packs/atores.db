by the magic of her song—knowledge of the people who constructed the monument and the mythic saga it depicts.</p><p>A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.</p><p>Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions' words will be well received.</p><p>Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"4\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Music and Magic</span></span> <p>In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p><p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"5\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Learning from Experience</span></span> <p>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p><p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"6\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Bard</span></span> <p>Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character's background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There's no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.</p><p>Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions.

zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.  The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!  Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time; you should always be sure to wait and see if the beast attempts to rise once more before wandering deeper into the dungeon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Evil","race":null,"type":{"value":"undead","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"Urban","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 316","class":{},"notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":"","gender":"","age":"","height":"","weight":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"understands the languages it knew in life but can't speak"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Zombie","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/undead/Zombie.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightColor":null,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"mJP9d8iNAVKQVp7b","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"_id":"Ed7XgnZu9qRs3qdn","name":"Slam","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\"><p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+3 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

Sua família, assim como a maioria daquela região, vivia da terra e da criação de porcos e gado. Sonr foi o primogênito do casal  Leyl e Thorbram. Para um primogênito, Sonr demorou a nascer, tendo o casal completado muitos anos juntos. Por um tempo, pensaram até que Odin, o pai dos pais, não os abençoaria com uma criança, mas Sonr nasceu prematuro em um duro inverno de quase 8 meses. Após Sonr, todos os anos o casal conseguiu ter mais um filho e sua família cresceu.</span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-fbea014a-7fff-5ade-a1d1-7bb25094a1ad\" style=\"font-weight:normal\"> </strong></p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\">Desde pequeno, Sonr demonstrou ser um pouco diferente das outras crianças. Por vezes, ele sorria quando se machucava e chorava apenas por ver seus irmãos menores chorando. Thorbram sentia que seu filho às vezes não parecia pertencer àquela família, tentando forçadamente se adequar e imitar os outros. Mas ele nunca imaginaria a extensão de seus problemas. Quando tinha aproximadamente 6 anos, Sonr quando ajudava Leyl a colocar seus irmãos para dormir, os enfiou em um transe profundo.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight:normal\"> </strong></p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\">Por 2 dias inteiros as crianças dormiram, e estariam dormindo até hoje se o xamã local não tivesse intervisto. Na verdade, aquele não era o primeiro incidente estranho com Sonr, mas o primeiro que quase custou a vida de seus parentes. O xamã local então em suas divinações, procurou respostas para o garoto. Nem mesmo ele tinha certeza, mas o que o xamã viu foi assombroso. Sonr, para ele, era um garoto que não devia ter nascido. Ele não pertencia a Midgard, ou Niefelheim, Yothungard e nem mesmo a terra do Aesir, Aesgard.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight:normal\"> </strong></p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\">Sonr, em suas palavras, era um errante, alguém que não pertencia a lugar nenhum e que todos os mundos o rejeitariam. Aquele efeito que assolou sua família, era uma magia poderosa vinda da rejeição de Niflhelm. Quando perguntados o que poderiam fazer, o Xamã apenas balançou a cabeça em tristeza. Ele nunca havia visto um errante como ele, mas ouviu que pessoas assim existiam para mover as engrenagens do destino e levar o mundo a seu caminho. Esse caminho, para alguns, terminava no fim de tudo - O Ragnarok.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight:normal\"> </strong></p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\">Para o xamã, o jovem devia ser sacrificado em nome de Odin, afim de proteger o pacto e a vontade dos Aesirs com todo o mundo. Mas aquilo era demais para o pobre casal, que muito pouco entendiam sobre o mundo. Não era de se culpar, afinal muito do que o xamã os contava parecia besteira. Ainda assim, a criança era uma ameaça e Thorbram prometeu cumprir as ordens do xamã e sacrificar o filho, mas pediu que fosse feito no Solstício de Inverno, no aniversário da criança.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight:normal\"> </strong></p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\">Por um bom tempo o casal pensou, mas no dia do sétimo aniversário de Sonr, seus pais o presentiaram com todas as suas economias e o mandaram embora. \"Vá para o mais longe daqui, e nunca mais volte! Você é uma ameaça para si mesmo e todos ao seu redor”. E ele foi. O garoto começou a viajar de vila em vila, tentando se manter como podia. O dinheiro que tinha acabou no segundo mês e logo teve que partir para roubos.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap\">Os perigos de sua vida, despertavam cada vez mais seus poderes e faziam assim ganhar notoriedade entre os órfãos do lugar.  Foi com 11 anos a primeira vez que um mercador pediu para o ladrãozinho tomar conta de uns rapazes que ameaçavam roubar seus tomates. Com seus dons, foi fácil demais. Então, entre roubos e trabalhos, Sonr se manteve e cresceu, sempre fugindo para outra vila, outra cidade, quando seus dons se tornavam problemáticos demais e sua cabeça estava a prêmio. Hoje, 10 anos depois, Sonr já atua como mercenário a um bom tempo e vive a vida de trabalho em trabalho, de cidade em cidade, tentando conter o destino que ele nem sabe que tem.</span></p>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral","race":"Human (Variant)","background":"Urchin","originalClass":"hXIauj1Uv0mDSGTg","xp":{"value":900,"min":0,"max":2700,"pct":0},"appearance":"<p><img src=\"Ashen_Avatar.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"253\" /></p>","trait":"I sleep with my back to a wall or tree, with everything I own wrapped in a bundle in my arms.\n\nI bluntly say what others are hinting at or hiding.","ideal":"People.

a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.</p><p>Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.</p><p>Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.</p><p>Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can't study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"54\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Raw Magic</span></span> <p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p><p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p><p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"55\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Unexplained Powers</span></span> <p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like to stay quiet. A sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't called on.</p><p>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"56\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Sorcerer</span></span> <p>The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?</p><p>How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you've been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"57\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions.

class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p><p>After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.</p><p>Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p><p>Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"9\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Deadly Hunters</span></span> <p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p><p>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"10\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Independent Adventurers</span></span> <p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.</p><p>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"11\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Ranger</span></span> <p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p><p>What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers?

Cultists, as their name describes, are those members of a secret underground society (or cult) whom very often practice a dark and unholy religion with their fellows. Beware adventurer! Not every cult is simply based around religious pretexts, there are those who seek political movements, those who are power hungry, and those who deign to meddle with forces our histories have lost long ago. Let me describe for you the very basics of common cult activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends on the Other Side.</strong> Cultists operate entirely in secrecy outside of the normal comings and goings of everyday life. What makes the cultist so fascinating is that they often attempt to blend seamlessly in with common folk: the barkeep at your favorite tavern, the guard near the gate, or even the dancer upon the stage may all be part of an underground community based ostensibly in evil. Now, to be clear, I do not encourage paranoia as cult activity is relatively rare in comparison to other, more immediate threats to our world; however, should a clever adventurer keep a keen eye out for secretive motions or gestures, odd symbols or markings, and even whispered code words, they can be certain they have stumbled into the workings of a cult. Quite commonly cultists align themselves with an ancient power trapped or dormant somewhere upon one of the more foul planes of existence. Their goals with this dark, godly force are myriad but often include control of a political structure, the deaths of hundreds if not thousands, or simply to sew despair and chaos across the realms of mortals. Unlike the desperate and cowardly bandits pushed to the brink by circumstance, cultists are often irredeemable foes. These men and women have been programed, brain-washed, or even directly controlled by their benefactor into the ways of darkness; often they are unfortunately unable to return to society once they have ingratiated themselves too deeply within the cult's network. Cults should always be handled and broken up with the utmost care; though the humanoid pawns behind the cult can be more easily dealt with, it should be remembered that cosmically evil forces may be at work and already set well into motion behind those pawns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Non-Good Alignment","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{},"notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Cultist","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Cultist.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"ptQexroSNsFMQd4j","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"_id":"nfPMecUVS2iOgAKJ","name":"Leather Armor","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil.

Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"53\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Shady Living</span></span> <p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"54\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Rogue</span></span> <p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character's relationship to the law.

Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?</p><p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support.

He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people's elk herd.</p><p>A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.</p><p>Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.</p><p>These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.</p><p>For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Primal Instinct</span></span> <p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.</p><p>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Life of Danger</span></span> <p>Not every member of the tribes deemed \"barbarians\" by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.</p><p>Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Barbarian</span></span> <p>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?</p><p>What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to \"civilized\" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions.

They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections. Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"10\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Artificers in Many Worlds</span></span> <p>Throughout the D&amp;D multiverse, artificers create inventions and magic items of peace and war.

When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#cure%20wounds_phb\" data-plutonium-actor-sheet-item=\"{&quot;actorId&quot;:&quot;a5KGc8ovIUsiJ5mL&quot;,&quot;itemId&quot;:&quot;vThmwnl8S3Se5zDV&quot;}\">cure wounds</a> using <a href=\"https://5e.tools/items.html#alchemist's%20supplies_phb\">alchemist's supplies</a>, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using <a href=\"https://5e.tools/items.html#tinker's%20tools_phb\">tinker's tools</a>, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#poison%20spray_phb\">poison spray</a>, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p><p>The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#cure%20wounds_phb\" data-plutonium-actor-sheet-item=\"{&quot;actorId&quot;:&quot;a5KGc8ovIUsiJ5mL&quot;,&quot;itemId&quot;:&quot;vThmwnl8S3Se5zDV&quot;}\">cure wounds</a> with <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#heat%20metal_phb\">heat metal</a>, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p><p>Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"24\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</span></span> <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstlevel:0=1,flstclass:artificer=1\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p><p>When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"25\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Preparing and Casting Spells</span></span> <p>The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstclass:artificer=1\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#cure%20wounds_phb\" data-plutonium-actor-sheet-item=\"{&quot;actorId&quot;:&quot;a5KGc8ovIUsiJ5mL&quot;,&quot;itemId&quot;:&quot;vThmwnl8S3Se5zDV&quot;}\">cure wounds</a>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"26\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spellcasting Ability</span></span> <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill.

class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her song—knowledge of the people who constructed the monument and the mythic saga it depicts.</p><p>A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.</p><p>Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions' words will be well received.</p><p>Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"15\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Music and Magic</span></span> <p>In the worlds of D&amp;D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p><p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"16\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Learning from Experience</span></span> <p>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p><p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"17\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Bard</span></span> <p>Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character's background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There's no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.</p><p>Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"18\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions.

Dwellers of the coastal urban sprawl see the armored law keepers near daily as they patrol the streets, guard our gates, inspect shipments, and of course assist (or arrest) those citizens of their fair cities. However, the guard is not only bound by the gates and ramparts of a city's walls. Be they mercenary or professional, guards are often found patrolling the roads, either to sweep away stray packs of animals or bandits, or on alert to protect precious cargo or important citizens as they travel the less settled areas of the world. Much like the bandits and cultists who we have previously discussed in this tome, guards come in all varieties. Though many may seem to be highly trained and regimented, it should be considered that most guards see no more action than a tussle on the busy streets of a market or scattering a few bandit scavengers from an upturned wagon. Guards are not all the hardened and grizzled ex-military types we think of at the upper ranks of the orders. Be observant, young adventurer, and heed the warnings of the law, for while the guards may only be a minor threat to your dastardly visions, what lays in wait in the city dungeon may not be worth the risks!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Alignment","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 347","class":{},"notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Guard","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/GuardBlueM.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"0VyQ6bWbtkGjJLiH","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"_id":"2reHgwNJRFbhmxqA","name":"Chain Shirt","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather.

He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people's elk herd.</p><p>A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.</p><p>Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.</p><p>These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.</p><p>For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Primal Instinct</span></span> <p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.</p><p>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"5\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Life of Danger</span></span> <p>Not every member of the tribes deemed \"barbarians\" by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.</p><p>Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"6\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Barbarian</span></span> <p>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?</p><p>What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to \"civilized\" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"7\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions.

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":null,"cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Commoner","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/HumanBrownM.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"36DFXralLheeKDCy","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+2 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.</p><p>Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists' activities.</p><p>Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.</p><p>Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"13\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Power of Nature</span></span> <p>Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.</p><p>Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"14\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Preserve the Balance</span></span> <p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.</p><p>Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.</p><p>Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"15\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Druid</span></span> <p>When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.</p><p>Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"16\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/backgrounds.html#hermit_phb\">hermit</a> background.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"17\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sacred Plants and Wood</span></span><p>A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p><p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p><p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"18\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Druids and the Gods</span></span><p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.</p><p>In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.</p><p>The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","levels":3,"subclass":"Circle of Stars","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":1,"saves":[],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":[],"value":["prc","sur"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"GcOAHT2TLbTyopxL":3},"flags":{"srd5e":{"isPrimaryClass":true}}},{"_id":"w0KF8z9MMF4mFbNX","name":"Druidic","type":"feat","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/yellow_41.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>You know <a href=\"https://5e.tools/languages.html#druidic_phb\">Druidic</a>, the secret language of druids.

When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed.

Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.

An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.</p><p>A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.</p><p>A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd's delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.</p><p>All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"68\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Well-Rounded Specialists</span></span> <p>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"69\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Trained for Danger</span></span> <p>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen's army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.</p><p>Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"70\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Fighter</span></span> <p>As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p><p>You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them.

a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.</p><p>Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.</p><p>Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.</p><p>Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can't study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"77\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Raw Magic</span></span> <p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p><p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p><p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"78\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Unexplained Powers</span></span> <p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like to stay quiet. A sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't called on.</p><p>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"79\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Sorcerer</span></span> <p>The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?</p><p>How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you've been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"80\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions.

companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.</p><p>A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.</p><p>Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard's belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.</p><p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Skill and Precision</span></span> <p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Shady Living</span></span> <p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Rogue</span></span> <p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character's relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves' guild master? Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?</p><p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions.

class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p><p>After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.</p><p>Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p><p>Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Deadly Hunters</span></span> <p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p><p>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Independent Adventurers</span></span> <p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.</p><p>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Ranger</span></span> <p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p><p>What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions.

For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.</p><p>An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion.

class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p><p>After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.</p><p>Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p><p>Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"10\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Deadly Hunters</span></span> <p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p><p>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"11\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Independent Adventurers</span></span> <p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.</p><p>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"12\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Ranger</span></span> <p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p><p>What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"13\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions.

Here we will view the commonalities of what would be considered the “bandit” class of criminal. Be advised while reviewing this information that not all bandits should be viewed with a scornful eye. While many seek harm or riches from their quarry, others thieve to survive in a world most unfair.</p>\n<p><strong>The Good.</strong> We begin with those bandits who could be seen as “noble criminals”. These bandits consist of the most downtrodden of our nations, those citizens who have struggled through poverty and oppression to scrape out a meager existence clinging to any comfort they can grasp. Consider what would drive a person to commit something so desperate as robbery or open theft in a village street. Bandits of a nobler sort may still be selfish with their earnings, taking what they have stolen to enrich their own lives or those of immediate relations. There are some bandits, however, who seek to use their pilfered goods to improve the lives of the poorer community. Be aware that often these bandits are desperate and afraid, especially during the act of robbery. They are scared, driven to crime by poor circumstances, so they may not require violence to disperse as more often than not they will not physically harm their victims. Keep an open mind as you travel through the world young adventurer and remember that were the tables turned, you may wish for mercy for such a minor infraction.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad and Ugly.</strong> For every good-hearted soul stealing from those with too much and giving to the unfortunate, there is a truly villainous spirit lurking behind the brush of a nearby road, lying in wait for an unsuspecting victim. During your travels, adventurer, these sorts may be the most common instances of banditry you will experience. Armed with swords, clubs, and bows, the more nefarious of the bandit world prefer to ambush their prey from the shadows of hills and trees, catching traveling parties unaware. These treacherous thieves will attempt diversion and trickery in order to catch their quarry off guard should their crew be outnumbered. Bandits have no boundaries of borders or locale, so caution should be taken whether you walk upon a forested road or sail the high seas as you island hop for fame.

They respect only brute strength and skill in battle, demonstrating both with their scars and the grisly trophies they take from their enemies.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1658\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hearts of Ice.</span></span> <p>Frost giants are creatures of ice and snow. Their hair and beards are pale white or light blue, matted with frost and clattering with icicles. Their flesh is as blue as glacial ice.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Frost giants dwell in high peaks and glacial rifts where the sun hides its golden head by winter. Crops don't grow in their frozen homelands, and they keep little livestock beyond what they capture in their raids against civilized lands. They hunt the wild game of the tundra and mountains but don't cook it, since meat from a fresh kill tastes sufficiently hot to their palate.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1659\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Reavers of the Storm.</span></span> <p>The war horns of the frost giants howl as they march from their ice fortresses and glacial rifts amid the howling blizzard. When that storm clears, villages and steadings lay in ruins, ravens descending to feed on the corpses of any creatures foolish or unlucky enough to stand in the giants' path.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Inns and taverns suffer the brunt of the damage, their cellars gutted and their casks of ale and mead gone. Smithies are likewise toppled, their iron and steel claimed. Curiously undisturbed are the houses of moneylenders and wealthy citizens, for the reavers have little use for coins or baubles. Frost giants prize gems and jewelry large enough to be worn and noticed. However, even those treasures are most often saved for trading opportunities with other giants more adept at crafting metal weapons and armor.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1660\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rulers by Might.</span></span> <p>Frost giants respect brute strength above all else, and a frost giant's place in the ordning depends on evidence of physical might, such as superior musculature, scars from battles of renown, or trophies fashioned from the bodies of slain enemies. Tasks such as hunting, childrearing, and crafting are given to giants based on their physical strength and hardiness.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>When frost giants of different clans meet and their status is unclear, they wrestle for dominance. Such meetings might resemble festivals where giants cheer on their champions, making bold boasts and challenges. At other times, the informal ceremony can become a chaotic free-for-all where both clans rush into a melee that fells trees, shatters the ice on frozen lakes, and causes avalanches on the snowy mountainsides.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1661\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Make War, Not Goods.</span></span> <p>Though frost giants consider the menial crafting of goods beneath them, carving and leatherwork are valued skills. They make their clothing from the skins and bones of beasts, and carve bone or ivory into jewelry and the handles of weapons and tools. They reuse the weapons and armor of their smaller foes, stringing shields into scale armor and lashing sword blades to wooden hafts to make giant-sized spears. The greatest battle trophies come from conquered dragons, and the greatest frost giant jarls wear armor of dragon scales or wield picks and mauls made of a dragon's teeth or claws.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"1662\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Giants</span></span> <p>Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked beneath the giants' feet. In those lost days, these towering figures were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and traditions of old.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1663\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Old as Legend</span></span> <p>In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths, monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands, now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.</p><p>Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the giants' heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race's glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area without a fight.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1664\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Ordning</span></span> <p>Each of the main giant races-the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants-are related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.</p><p>Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.</p><p>At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.</p><p>Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"1665\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Giant Gods</span></span><p>When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants, forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly villains that make up the giants' pantheon.</p><p>Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden; Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster.</p><p>Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults, paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other non-giant deity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain to make a giant an outcast.</p><div

Dwellers of the coastal urban sprawl see the armored law keepers near daily as they patrol the streets, guard our gates, inspect shipments, and of course assist (or arrest) those citizens of their fair cities. However, the guard is not only bound by the gates and ramparts of a city's walls. Be they mercenary or professional, guards are often found patrolling the roads, either to sweep away stray packs of animals or bandits, or on alert to protect precious cargo or important citizens as they travel the less settled areas of the world. Much like the bandits and cultists who we have previously discussed in this tome, guards come in all varieties. Though many may seem to be highly trained and regimented, it should be considered that most guards see no more action than a tussle on the busy streets of a market or scattering a few bandit scavengers from an upturned wagon. Guards are not all the hardened and grizzled ex-military types we think of at the upper ranks of the orders. Be observant, young adventurer, and heed the warnings of the law, for while the guards may only be a minor threat to your dastardly visions, what lays in wait in the city dungeon may not be worth the risks!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Alignment","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":1,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 347","class":{},"notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":"","gender":"","age":"","height":"","weight":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Guard","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/GuardBlueM.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"4ccJDod0mxJKxF1p","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"_id":"2reHgwNJRFbhmxqA","name":"Chain Shirt","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather.

The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p><p>The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#cure%20wounds_phb\" data-plut-hover=\"{&quot;page&quot;:&quot;spells.html&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PHB&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;cure%20wounds_phb&quot;}\">cure wounds</a> with <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#heat%20metal_phb\" data-plut-hover=\"{&quot;page&quot;:&quot;spells.html&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PHB&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;heat%20metal_phb&quot;}\">heat metal</a>, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p><p>Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"16\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</span></span> <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstlevel:0=1,flstclass:artificer=1\">artificer spell list</a>.

These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.</p><p>A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3171\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Vain and Deadly.</span></span> <p>A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm's reach as it waits to attack again.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3172\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Desert Predators.</span></span> <p>Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3173\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Overlords and Minions.</span></span> <p>Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3174\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hoarders of Gems.</span></span> <p>Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelery and magic items adorned with those gems.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3175\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Blue Dragon's Lair.</span></span> <p>Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath the sands.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon's first line of defense.</p><p>A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions-along with the wealth of the dead intruders.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3176\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chromatic Dragons.</span></span> <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3177\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Driven by Greed.</span></span> <p> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3178\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Ego.</span></span> <p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3179\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dangerous Lairs.</span></span> <p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3180\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Queen of Evil Dragons.</span></span> <p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p><p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p></div></div><p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p><p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p><p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p><p>Dragon Age Categories</p><table class=\" stripe-odd-table\"><thead><tr><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Category</th><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Size</th><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Age Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Wyrmling</td><td class=\"col-4\">Medium</td><td class=\"col-4\">5 years or less</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Young</td><td class=\"col-4\">Large</td><td class=\"col-4\">6–100 years</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Adult</td><td class=\"col-4\">Huge</td><td class=\"col-4\">101–800 years</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4\">Ancient</td><td class=\"col-4\">Gargantuan</td><td class=\"col-4\">801 years or more</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3181\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lair Actions.</span></span> <p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it.

are the largest of the wild dog species roaming the plains and forests of our wonderful world.  Anywhere from light brown to a midnight black in coloration, wolves stand as the common ancestor to all natural dog species currently inhabiting the planet.  Wolves have a long, broad muzzle filled with sharp teeth, a thick coat to insulate them from difficult winters, and keen eyes and ears with which they may track a target.  The most amazing aspect of the wolf is its incredible nose which can smell prey from up to one and a half miles away.  This amazing nose (packed with hundreds of millions of scent receptors) can also determine the mood of other wolves, what they’ve eaten, and even where they’ve been..</p>\n<p><strong>The Wolves Among Us.</strong> As is common with many other dog species, wolves live in communities called packs.  WIthin the pack, wolves hunt together, raise their young together, and provide group protection.  When encountering wolves, be wary should you only spy a single animal prowling the area.  It’s quite likely where there is a straggler wolf, the rest of the pack lurks nearby ready to defend their family from attack.  Wolves, which unable to speak, are able to “communicate” via barks and growls as well as follow simplistic tactics such as flanking maneuvers or surprise attacks.  The strength of the pack allows for the wolves to combine their intelligence and form a deadly fighting force of gnashing teeth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.</p><p>Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.</p><p>Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.</p><p>Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can't study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"22\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Raw Magic</span></span> <p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p><p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p><p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"23\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Unexplained Powers</span></span> <p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like to stay quiet. A sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't called on.</p><p>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"24\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Sorcerer</span></span> <p>The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?</p><p>How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you've been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"25\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions.

gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.</p><p>Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists' activities.</p><p>Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.</p><p>Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"23\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Power of Nature</span></span> <p>Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.</p><p>Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"24\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Preserve the Balance</span></span> <p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.</p><p>Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.</p><p>Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"25\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Druid</span></span> <p>When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.</p><p>Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"26\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/backgrounds.html#hermit_phb\">hermit</a> background.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"27\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sacred Plants and Wood</span></span><p>A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p><p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p><p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"28\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Druids and the Gods</span></span><p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.</p><p>In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.</p><p>The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","levels":3,"subclass":"Circle of the Shepherd","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":[],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":[],"value":["ani","nat"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"05k4ub2VgC3VLxAg":3},"flags":{"srd5e":{"isPrimaryClass":true}}},{"_id":"AkQrRQh0HEshRJM6","name":"Druidic","type":"feat","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/yellow_41.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>You know <a href=\"https://5e.tools/languages.html#druidic_phb\">Druidic</a>, the secret language of druids.

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#unconscious_phb\">unconscious</a>.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#call%20lightning_phb\">call lightning</a>, that you've already cast.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.

Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.

curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.</p><p>As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic.</p><p>Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.</p><p>Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"15\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sworn and Beholden</span></span> <p>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron's behalf.</p><p>The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"16\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Delvers into Secrets</span></span> <p>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.</p><p>Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student's mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.</p><p>Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"17\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Warlock</span></span> <p>As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?</p><p>Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character's adventuring career. Your patron's demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.</p><p>What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron's plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?</p><p>How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron's voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds—messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"18\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions.

Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.</p><p>Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.</p><p>Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.</p><p>Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Scholars of the Arcane</span></span> <p>Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.</p><p>Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Lure of Knowledge</span></span> <p>Wizards' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.</p><p>But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities.

first time you see those hollow sockets staring back at you with some semblance of thought inside the skull, I advise to quash any feelings of accomplishment.  The skeletal servant you have raised is little more than a brainless husk.  Without proper, and I mean proper, instruction, the bones in front of you might as well have remained dusty upon the floor.  Explain the orders carefully and lay out the steps of your new servant’s tasks with exceeding care.  Also, should you catch your skeletal friend partaking in the activities of their former life, do not scold them.  The mundane routine of chopping wood or swinging a hammer can allow for more malleable servants as time continues.<br /><em>The Book of Dark Servants, Vol III.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Skeletons are beings raised into undeath by the will of necromantic magic.  The necromantic magics used within the ritual can either be cast by a trained hand or simply seep into the bones of the skeleton in areas of concentrated death.  Cemeteries, catacombs, and battle fields are all subject to the sporadic rising of skeletons into their new lives.  The magic not only keeps the skeleton “living”, but it also binds joints and bones together like spectral ligaments.  With its second life, the skeleton acts as a semi-mindless creature serving its master’s will.</p>\n<p><strong>Spooky Scary.</strong> For the up and coming necromancer, skeletons make worthy guards for a hidden repository of forbidden knowledge.  Skeletons will follow simple to mildly complex orders given (such as forming a protective circle or constructing minor defenses) without the necromancer needing to worry about the durability of their creations.  The skeletons will avoid danger and refuse to injure themselves unless explicitly ordered by their master.  Skeletons do seem to grow rather bored without direction and have been observed ambling around an area performing simple actions from their past lives.  One notable skeleton I recall was still able to cast their fishing line, though clumsily at best, into the nearby lake.  Skeletons, however, are not utilized for their prior skills but as guardians of the necromancer who summoned them back from the hells.  Skeletons are more than capable when swinging a sword or firing a crossbow, finding martial prowess in death that they may have lacked in life thanks to the dark power flowing through their marrow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Author’s Note: Not all skeletal adversaries in an adventurer’s journey will be humanoid.  Be wary, as significant magics can summon back more powerful skeletal monsters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope
